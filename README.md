Part A:
I really really wanted to do this assignment and still might attempt it.
The fact that it was extra credit coupled with my bad time management and
busy schedule stopped me from getting it done.  I was hoping this extra
credit would make up for turning in the assignment late but I just ended up
having no time..

Part B:
I used a sphere and two torus to create an interesting SDF shape.  I was going
for a magical artifact/magical energy kind of look.  Looks like some kind of
crystal ball or something.

Part C:
I researched viscous liquid simulations.
